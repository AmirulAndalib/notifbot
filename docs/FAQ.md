# AutoNotif FAQ

## How do I add an app to AutoNotif?

Basically, share the app from Google Play to AutoNotif. Here are the detailed steps:

 1. Go to the Google Play page of the app you want to add
    ([example](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartthings.android))
 1. Find the Share button (last time I checked, it's right below the reviews)
 1. Choose AutoNotif in the Share menu
 1. You should see a Toast afterwards as feedback
